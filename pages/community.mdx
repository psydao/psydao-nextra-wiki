# ðŸ’¬ Community Guidelines (CoC)

Our DAO exists for the free sharing of information and facilitation of connection within our global psychedelic community. We want to ensure members can feel as comfortable as possible in sharing this space, and as such have a few guidelines for consideration.

Doâ€™s
- Practice compassion and empathy for your fellow community members
- Hold space for diversity of perspectives in discussion
- Help others when alignment is identified

Dontâ€™s
- Hateful speech of any kind
- Soliciting of drugs and medicines
- Spam or excessive shilling

As a general rule ask yourself: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?

Our community team will respond to breaches of these guidelines accordingly, with transparent communication to the party in violation and any other members affected. Depending on the severity of the breach, our response can range from a temporary timeout to a permanent banning.

If anyone or anything is making you feel unsafe, uncomfortable or unwelcome in our community, we would like to help you to the most of our abilities. Please feel free to contact someone with the Psycore or Community WG role as we will proceed from there.
