# ðŸ’Ÿ DEI

DEI - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - is undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of a sustainably balanced organization. Given the overall lack of diverse representation in the Web 3 space currently, and the importance of respecting the broad range of cultures from which many psychedelic compounds discussed today originate, cultivating a culture with intentional respect to DEI is especially important for PsyDAO.

Diversity of perspective is essential to avoid siloing of organizational direction and energetic output; reaching a middle ground between people who have experienced life through different lenses ensures our group grows in a way that aligns to the benefits of the many. Reasoning is a collective effort, biologically not intended for one human individual. We are biopsychosocietal beings, communal creatures that depend on our tribe to reach a balanced consensus. DEI also has important implications on the personal growth of all members involved in the community. By holding space for a wide range of perspectives and actively receiving inputs that are outside of our typical realm of thinking, we can all expand as individuals much more than in a monotone culture.

The most valuable part of any organization (DAO) is its community - the individuals who constitute its collective identity. We seek to be mindful of just representation, organizational success, and creating a harmonious ecosystem. If you have feelings towards this cultivation, or skills that can help us bring increased balance, we would love to hear from you.
