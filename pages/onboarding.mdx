# üèÑ Onboarding

Onboarding is an iterative process that will improve as our DAO scales. For now, anyone looking to join the PsyDAO community is best self served in developing shared context by:

- Reading this Wiki
- Engaging with resources on our [website](https://psydao.io/) including our manifesto [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFIO5LJ8sP8) and newsletter
- Joining our Discord and going through the channels in the ‚ÄòOnboarding‚Äô channel section

If you are coming into the DAO with a specific intention, be sure to mention that as you introduce yourself in our server - a member of the team will reach out and engage further.

## ~ Discord Onboarding Flow ~

When new members join our Discord, they will be guided through a series of channels to comfortably integrate them into our community. Each step in the system has a degree of challenge, and an equal degree of reward (‚Äôas above so below‚Äô). The process involves giving you context on our DAO and the levels of engagement possible, as well as standard verification and security measures. The channels flow as follows:

- **Welcome** ‚Äî Sets the tone, links to our Wiki and other sources on PsyDAO, invites you to explore the DAO
- **Values and Rules** ‚Äî Establishes community guidelines and gives context on our culture
- **Verification** ‚Äî Standard bot verification to ensure sever security
- **Introductions** ‚Äî This opens up further communication and helps actualize your ambitions within our shared space
- **Contribution** ‚Äî Invites you to join a working group through our Airtable and contributor onboarding process (not required to be a member of the DAO)

## ~ Contributor Onboarding ~

As someone interested in PsyDAO, **you do not need to join as a contributor to still be a valuable part of the community**. Sharing space with others, resonating with information shared, and offering your own resources and perspectives to the community is the primary way our collective stays healthy and alive.

If you decide you have capacity and interest in joining a working group, the process flows as follows:

- You fill out the Airtable and specify which working groups are your primary and secondary interest. For ease of communication, please leave your discord name at the bottom!
- The stewards of your selected working groups will review your application and identify alignment between the needs of the DAO and your background. They will then contact you with next steps.
- If you are selected to join a working group, you will be invited into the internal WG channel and gain access to our contributor onboarding calls, where you will be further guided on how to effectively join our collective calls to action.
