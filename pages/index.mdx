# ðŸ‘¥ Who We Are
 
**PsyDAO** is a DeSci and Social DAO building the future of decentralized psychedelic research and culture. We are the digital port city for psychedelia - a group of creators, community builders, psychonauts, and lifelong students. Our shared digital space is a place for people to orient their learning and engagement with the broader psychedelic and DeSci ecosystem.

## Our Intentions

PsyDAO intends to be a hivemind - a literal collective consciousness for the ethical development of psychedelics. The goal of PsyDAO is to redesign incentives and access from the bottom up - focusing on people (patients, recreational users, and spiritual communities), as opposed to centralizing ownership within organizations that have intrinsically misaligned incentives. We see two distinct, yet complementary approaches related to the governance of psychedelic knowledge and related intellectual property - open source and community-governed.

Our species needs a radical shift in consciousness to preserve its light for the future. These molecules open up a whole new level of human experience that should be available to everyone. We must ensure that this world is available to anyone.
