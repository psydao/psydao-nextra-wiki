# ü™µ DAO Structure

PsyDAO is organized into 3 main branches that intertwine and coordinate to ensure success of the DAO and community efforts. These sections are

## ‚ú®Community

The Community Working Group holds the DAO together, and is primarily responsible for curating culture through events and media channels.

A culture welcoming and accessible to psychedelic researchers, visionary artists, psychonauts and enthusiasts is central to the sustainable success and enjoyment of the DAO. Mechanisms primarily manifest through driving engagement and education of members (including IRL events, partnerships, etc), driving awareness of PsyDAO‚Äôs offerings (newsletter, podcast, infographics, etc), and ensuring the successful launch of DAO engagement strategies (genesis NFT collection, GR16, etc).

The primary focus for members of the working group are to:

- Support the creation of information and content through our media channels
- Engage new members and assist in developing a person-centered welcome into our shared space (primarily discord currently)
- Iterate on our systems for managing members and development of DAO context, e.g. our onboarding system, public documentation, and social media strategies
- Bring creative input from your own experiences and intrinsic interests - whether it‚Äôs a novel initiative, or on malleable projects such as our merchandise.
- Facilitate events for the community, both IRL and URL

## üçÑ Research

The Research Working Group embodies the intention of the DAO to support psychedelic research, and serves as an anchor point for researchers and deals growing in our community.

Members of the working group primarily **find, evaluate and recommend early-stage research projects for funding by the DAO**. Community-guided development and commercialization of novel Psychedelic IP is a key part of PsyDAO‚Äôs mission, and is a high-potential source of revenue for PsyDAO‚Äôs treasury. Primary focuses of include to:

- Find or refer early-stage Psychedelic research projects that the DAO may be interested in funding (What kind of projects/deals are we looking for? Guidelines in development)
- Share and promote high potential applications within the PsyDAO community through regular Discord and Newsletter updates, presentations, Q&A sessions, reports, etc.
- Work with successful applicants to support them in successfully completing their projects in addition to continuing to share and promote these projects
- Recruit other members to the Research WG

## üå≥ Coordination

The Coordination Working Group ensures the operational and governance success of the DAO, keeping the community harmonious and in sync (both internally and in the broader ecosystem).

As the DAO grows it‚Äôs research funding stream and it‚Äôs community of psychonauts, the Coordination Working Group is the integrative piece facilitating horizontal connectedness. This includes decisions around big picture subjects such as tokenomics, our business model, our brand, etc.
