# ❓ FAQ

## What is PsyDAO?

PsyDAO is a DeSci and Social DAO building the future of decentralized psychedelic research and culture. We’re the digital port city for psychedelia - a group of creators, community builders, psychonauts and innovators. Our shared digital spaces exist for people to understand and facilitate the health of the DAO, as well as orient their learning and engagement with the broader psychedelic and DeSci ecosystem.

## What is PsyDAO’s purpose?

Our purpose is primarily twofold - to identify and fund psychedelic research projects, and to build a collective community of conscious individuals contributing to this psychedelic renaissance. This is reflected in our [DAO structure](/dao_structure)

## How does PsyDAO get funding?

Our funding comes from projects such as our NFT collections, token releases, and larger supports in the ecosystem like [Molecule](https://www.molecule.io/) and [Bio.xyz](https://www.bio.xyz).

## How do I participate in the DAO?

You can participate in the DAO at a range of levels. Simply showing up and sharing you perspectives in our community is very valuable! Joining community events and taking on tasks in bounty boards at your own pace is always welcome. If you want to deepen your involvement with the DAO and contribute directly to our efforts, consider applying to join a working group! For more info see our [How to Participate](https://wiki.psydao.io/en/how-to-participate-and-contribute/) page.

## Where can I learn more about Psychedelics?

Information around psychedelics have exploded in the last few years. Although increased access to information around psychedelic is wonderful, there has also been some dilution of the quality of information as such. When reading about the topic, always keep in mind what intentions the sources’ author has towards you. Study the sages who have been involved in the field for decades - Stan Grof, Rick Doblin, Dennis McKenna, etc… We also have some useful resource compiled on our [Psychedelic Resources](/resources) page.

## Where does PsyDAO have a presence?

Our current central hub is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/x2F9hh9n). We often host events such as our Town Hall on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psy_dao?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). At times we host IRL events and show up at conferences relating to Psychedelics and Web3 - be sure to keep an eye on the relevant channels in our Discord for more information on meetups!

## Is PsyDAO a research project itself?

We do not conduct any research directly in the DAO, but given that identifying and support research is central to our mission, many of our contributors are researchers themselves. By holding space for the congregation of research and researchers, we hope to cultivate fertile soil from which any researcher who join our community can find support in growing their own ideas.
